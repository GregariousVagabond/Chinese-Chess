# Chinese-Chess
A functional game for two players. Similar to chess, goal is to win by checkmate. Game will only allow legal moves to be passed and will prevent player from putting their General in check. Game will automatically change state from “unfinished” to declaring a winner once a player has no legal moves that would not result in check.
